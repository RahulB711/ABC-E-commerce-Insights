## Top Insights

## 1:CLV (customer life time value)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38aebaf9-233c-4e30-aa93-571e606be63f)

Based on my analysis, I concluded high CLV is equally influenced by purchase frequency, average order value (AOV), and customer lifespan. This balance highlights the importance of encouraging repeat purchases, increasing the average spend per transaction, and fostering long-term customer relationships.


## 2: Customer Distribution

This insight highlights that the number of repeated customers significantly exceeds the number of non-repeated customers. Additionally, the analysis shows a notable difference in the Average Order Value (AOV) between these customer groups

## 3: Top 5 Country,State by Revenue

 ## 4: RTO Office Impact:

Study the 'RTO Office' data to determine if the location of vehicle registration has any influence on pricing.

Here initially we find out same car model in different rto location discount car price are different as we deep dive into it we found these can be due to :

a:> different car Variants like Amanual,T(O) 1.0 Manual etc

b:> different car Fuel type like Petrol,Diesel etc

c:> different car ownereship

It gives us a better understanding of the project by providing us with summarised visiuals of significant insights discovered during the project

## Conclusion
