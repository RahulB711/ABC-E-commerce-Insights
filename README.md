## Top Insights

### 1:CLV (customer life time value)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38aebaf9-233c-4e30-aa93-571e606be63f)

Based on my analysis, I concluded high CLV is equally influenced by purchase frequency, average order value (AOV), and customer lifespan. This balance highlights the importance of encouraging repeat purchases, increasing the average spend per transaction, and fostering long-term customer relationships.


### 2: Customer Distribution

This insight highlights that the number of repeated customers significantly exceeds the number of non-repeated customers. Additionally, the analysis shows a notable difference in the Average Order Value (AOV) between these customer groups

### 3: Top 5 Country,State by Revenue

 ### 4: Order Delivery Performance

Over the years, the average delivery time (difference between order and delivery dates) has consistently decreased.
This indicates that the company has improved its logistics, supply chain management, and delivery operations.

### 5: Monthly Sales Trends

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6677f0c9-515d-444d-86c9-a28d59683ce5)

General Upward Trend:
•	Sales are growing steadily over time, showing strong business momentum.
Dip in October to November:
•	There is a slight dip in sales during these months, which might be due to seasonal factors, reduced demand, or insufficient marketing efforts.
Spike in December to January:
•	A significant spike in sales is observed from December to January, likely due to holiday or year-end shopping, discounts, or promotions

### 6: Top 20 Low-Performing Products

This observation suggests that the products contributing to the lowest performance in terms of sales or revenue are predominantly from the "eatable" category.
